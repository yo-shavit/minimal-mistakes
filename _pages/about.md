I'm a visiting researcher at Harvard University, working with Prof. Cynthia Dwork on ways of leveraging machine learning to facilitate fair decisionmaking. 
I recently finished [my Master's thesis](/assets/files/masters-thesis-final.pdf) at MIT, which I wrote on environment learning for model-based planning from sparse signals.
This site is going to serve as a disorganized cork-board for the various things I do, both professionally and personally.
