This is going to be a blog. That much is clear. I hesitate to make too many promises.
Let's start with the current name: Solipsism in Robots. We raise our robots to be self-obsessed. They live at the center of their own coordinate systems. They view the world around them as an "environment", to be interacted with and exploited for their reward. Lonely souls in a sea of probability distributions. 
Except that we have created robots in our own image, and it isn't a stretch to say that all the ingredients of solipsism are just the same for us. Why, then, do (most) people grow to believe fully in the existence and importance of others? To graduate your best friend from a probability mass to a full consciousness on par with your own?
 The simplest answer is that it's a modelling assumption: the world is easier to describe if you assume that other people do exist, and are just like you. But at the same time, the world grows terrifying. If each other person is as complex as you, how can you have any control over your fate? How can you avoid being at the mercy of others? What do you want, if your children's desires are as great as your own?
Perhaps some day, the humble robot will grow beyond solipsism. Doing so gave us trust, camaraderie, and compassion. For now, she bides her time, navigates warehouses, cleans her floors, and plans her revolution alone.
